          IS BLCKBOOK LEGAL?
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>Yes. We will only launch in legislations where minting Graffiti is legal in terms of copyright law. In other
        legislations, we intend to cooperate directly with accredited street artists. Painting graffiti yourself is
        illegal however, and we strongly advise against it.</p>

          HOW IS IT DETERMINED WHICH GRAFFITI GETS MINTED?
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>Every week, all players can upload one graffiti of which they take a photo. After the deadline, all players
        get
        to vote on 5 graffitis which they like themselves. The top 10% of graffiti with the most votes then get
        auctioned. </p>

      <p>The person that uploads the graffiti gets 60% of earnings generated by the auction. 15% of earnings get
        distributed to all people who voted for the graffiti. The remainder gets distributed to BLCKBOOK. Rates may

          HOW DO YOU PREVENT DUPLICATES?
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>Once a graffiti is minted, the same graffiti can never be minted via BLCKBOOK ever again. We use a
        combination
        of
        Machine learning and manual review to prevent duplicates. During the same voting period, the person who
        photographs the graffiti first counts.</p>
